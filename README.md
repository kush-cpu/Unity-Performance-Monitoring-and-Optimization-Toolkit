# Unity Performance Monitoring and Optimization Toolkit

## Description

This toolkit provides a comprehensive solution for monitoring and optimizing the performance of Unity games. It includes advanced profiling tools, automated performance reporting, optimization suggestions based on machine learning, and seamless integration with Unity Editor. The toolkit helps developers identify and resolve performance bottlenecks to ensure smooth and efficient gameplay experiences.

## Features

- **Advanced Profiling Tools**: Collect detailed performance metrics during gameplay, including frame rate, memory usage, CPU usage, and GPU frame time.
- **Automated Performance Reporting**: Generate comprehensive performance reports automatically after profiling sessions.
- **Optimization Suggestions**: Use machine learning models to provide specific optimization suggestions based on profiling data.
- **Custom Editor Dashboard**: Visualize profiling data and optimization suggestions in a user-friendly dashboard within the Unity Editor.
- **Easy Integration**: Seamlessly integrate the toolkit with your Unity project and CI/CD pipelines.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/UnityPerformanceToolkit.git
   cd UnityPerformanceToolkit
   ```

2. **Install TensorFlowSharp**
   - Download TensorFlowSharp from [TensorFlowSharp GitHub](https://github.com/SciSharp/TensorFlow.NET).
   - Add TensorFlowSharp to the `Plugins` directory in your Unity project.

3. **Install Python Dependencies**
   - Ensure you have Python installed.
   - Install the necessary Python libraries:
     ```sh
     pip install tensorflow pandas scikit-learn joblib
     ```

4. **Setup Unity Project**
   - Open your Unity project.
   - Import the `Assets/PerformanceToolkit` directory into your Unity project.

## Usage

### 1. Collect Data

1. Open `MainScene.unity` in the Unity Editor.
2. Attach the `DataCollector` script to a GameObject in your scene.
3. Run the game multiple times to collect profiling data, which will be saved in `PerformanceData.csv`.

### 2. Train the Model

1. Run the `train_model.py` script to train the neural network model and save the model and label encoder:
   ```sh
   python train_model.py
   ```

### 3. Integrate Model

1. Place the trained model `optimization_model.h5` in the `Assets/PerformanceToolkit/Models` directory.
2. Place the label encoder `label_encoder.pkl` in the `Assets/PerformanceToolkit/Resources` directory.

### 4. Use the Dashboard

1. Open the Unity Editor.
2. Go to `Window` -> `Performance Dashboard` to open the custom editor window.
3. Use the dashboard to visualize profiling data and get real-time optimization suggestions.
